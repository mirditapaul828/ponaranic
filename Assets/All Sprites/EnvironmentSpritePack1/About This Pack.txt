Thank you for buying this sprite pack.

Recently Added:
HD Set
Top Down Set - Currently in progress, treat this as a preview. An update of this might affect the order
of the sprites in future versions forcing you to remake maps.

In this pack you will find 4 versions of the Sprite set, each have some added effect 
on them that give it a little more style.

1) Original High res (with extended assets)
2) Lower Res, Painterly1 (no extended assets yet)*
3) Lower Res, Painterly2 (no extended assets yet)*
4) Lower Res, Smart Blur (no extended assets yet)*

Be sure to have a look at what set you like or use a mix if you like.

New assets will have the same process applied and supplied in the 4 variations


I hope you really enjoy these sprites!

All the best,
Robert Ramsay - RRFreelance.

Notes (for pixel perfect):
