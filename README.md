This project was created during quarentine. My colleague and I reflected back on the days of Flappy Bird and brainstormed on the idea of how to create an app that would be able to make the player feel the same emotions that they felt whilst playing Flappy Bird. With no experience building any games, we decided to give it a shot and have a rigid schedule set. Low and behold, we have brought upon Pona Ranic! It was an experience that will last us for years to come since it provided us the beauty in working with software and opening our eyes for what we wanted to go into in our lives.


### Built With

* C#
* Unity

The bats are on their way and so are the barbaric skeletons. aggressively glowing as they approach you, you must ward off the incoming bats and redirect the skeletons.

* Tap on the bats to kill them
* Drag the skeletons to any of the 3 traps location on the bottom of the screen.

Simply go to Google Play store or App Store and start playing today!
